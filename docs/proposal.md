# Final project proposal

## Hardware/software proposal 1
LED that moves left and right with turn of rotary encoder. Hardware: IP for rotary encoder. Software: reads rotary encoder register and changes LED register.
## Hardware/software proposal 2
Button (from rotary encoder) that turns on and off buzzer whose pitch is determined by rotary encoder. Hardware: Button (easy) and Buzzer IP (based off of PWM controller) Software: enables buzzer based off of button, changes pitch with change of LED from proposal 1


## Division of labor
Dirk will work on the hardware IP for the rotary encoder. Seth will work on the hardware IP for the buzzer. Dirk will work on the Software for Buzzer enable. Seth will work on the software for the changing LED.
